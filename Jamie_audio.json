Your children live to 100 and not have cancer because of technology. And literally they'll probably be working three and a half days a week. So technology has done unbelievable things for mankind. But you know planes crash. Pharmacists get misused. There are negatives. This one the biggest negative in my view is A.I. being used by bad people to do bad things. Think of cyber. You know Henry Kissinger talks about warfare. But you know the fact and I do think you know eventually have legal guardrails around. It's kind of hard to do because it's new but it will add a huge value.
