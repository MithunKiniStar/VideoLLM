0	6960	You've got a top notch group investigating A.I. What are they up to. What's the next level of finance you think A.I. can
6960	13440	unlock. Yeah I think the most important thing is that it's A.I. is real. We already have thousands of people doing it. Top
13440	20120	scientists around the world. Manuel Veloso from who ran Carnegie Mellon machine learning is a living breathing thing. So
20120	24720	people want to ask what's going to do. It's a living breathing thing. It's going to change. They're going to be all different
24720	31480	types of models and different types of tools and technology. But the way to think about for us is every single process. So
31480	39000	errors trading hedging research every app every database you can be applying A.I. so might be as a co-pilot. It might be to
39000	45400	replace humans. You know A.I. is doing all the equity hedging for us. For the most part it's idea generation is large
45400	51520	language models. It's note taking while you're talking to someone and most taking notes and actually say to you that here's
51520	56560	the thing of interest the client might be interested in all error all customer service. It's a little bit of everything. But it is
56560	63640	going to replace some jobs. Of course. Yeah. But I look folks people have to take a deep breath. OK. Technologies over always
63640	69600	replace jobs. Your children live to 100 and not have cancer because of technology. And literally they'll probably be working
69960	75360	three and a half days a week. So technology has done unbelievable things for mankind. But you know planes crash.
75360	82280	Pharmacists get misused. There are negatives. This one the biggest negative in my view is A.I. being used by bad people to do
82280	90120	bad things. Think of cyber. You know Henry Kissinger talks about warfare. But you know the fact and I do think you know
90120	96960	eventually have legal guardrails around. It's kind of hard to do because it's new but it will add a huge value. And you know for
96960	100520	JP Morgan if it replaces jobs you know we hope to redeploy people.
