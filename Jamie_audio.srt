00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,960
You've got a top notch group investigating A.I. What are they up to. What's the next level of finance you think A.I. can

2
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:13,440
unlock. Yeah I think the most important thing is that it's A.I. is real. We already have thousands of people doing it. Top

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:20,120
scientists around the world. Manuel Veloso from who ran Carnegie Mellon machine learning is a living breathing thing. So

4
00:00:20,120 --> 00:00:24,720
people want to ask what's going to do. It's a living breathing thing. It's going to change. They're going to be all different

5
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,480
types of models and different types of tools and technology. But the way to think about for us is every single process. So

6
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:39,000
errors trading hedging research every app every database you can be applying A.I. so might be as a co-pilot. It might be to

7
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,400
replace humans. You know A.I. is doing all the equity hedging for us. For the most part it's idea generation is large

8
00:00:45,400 --> 00:00:51,520
language models. It's note taking while you're talking to someone and most taking notes and actually say to you that here's

9
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,560
the thing of interest the client might be interested in all error all customer service. It's a little bit of everything. But it is

10
00:00:56,560 --> 00:01:03,640
going to replace some jobs. Of course. Yeah. But I look folks people have to take a deep breath. OK. Technologies over always

11
00:01:03,640 --> 00:01:09,600
replace jobs. Your children live to 100 and not have cancer because of technology. And literally they'll probably be working

12
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:15,360
three and a half days a week. So technology has done unbelievable things for mankind. But you know planes crash.

13
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:22,280
Pharmacists get misused. There are negatives. This one the biggest negative in my view is A.I. being used by bad people to do

14
00:01:22,280 --> 00:01:30,120
bad things. Think of cyber. You know Henry Kissinger talks about warfare. But you know the fact and I do think you know

15
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:36,960
eventually have legal guardrails around. It's kind of hard to do because it's new but it will add a huge value. And you know for

16
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,520
JP Morgan if it replaces jobs you know we hope to redeploy people.
